  ## Description

  Its a game to test ur knowledge about html, css, and js. It can be very useful as a review or someone getting into front end development and want to play a short game to learn or refres ur memory. This project is stil in progress but I have big plans for this project, I plan to add a heavy amount of questions so the chances of you running into the same question are slim that way you can learn something new each time, get most functionality to work like highscores and retry.
