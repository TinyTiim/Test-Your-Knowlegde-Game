  ## Description

  It's a game to test our knowledge of HTML, CSS, and js. It can be beneficial as a review or for someone getting into front-end development and wanting to play a short game to learn or refresh ur memory. This project is still in progress but I have big plans for this project, I plan to add a heavy amount of questions so the chances of you running into the same question are slim that way you can learn something new each time, and to add a progress bar.
